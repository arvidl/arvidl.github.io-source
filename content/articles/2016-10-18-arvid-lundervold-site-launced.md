Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be - thanks to [hankquinlan.github.io](  http://hankquinlan.github.io)!

Restructured the blog (2017-12-31) according to Jake Vanderplas (jakevdp) code https://github.com/jakevdp/jakevdp.github.io-source as seen in his Pythonic Perambulations blog http://jakevdp.github.io, where the articles can be made as Jupyter notebooks.
