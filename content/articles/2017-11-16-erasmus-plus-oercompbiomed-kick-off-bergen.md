Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership for higher education [OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOMEDICINE](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/bc4e0bdb-aa64-4d5c-a7f2-26d68ec36647) 

OERCompBiomed Start: 01-09-2017 - End: 31-08-2020

EU Grant: 363670 EUR

OERCompBiomed delivers four integrated intellectual outputs (IOs) that provide novel learning material in the form of three OERs/courses (Biomedical ethics, Translational digital pathology and Introduction to Computational Biomedicine and Machine Learning), and in the form of an intensive course (Summer School in Computational Biomedicine) with blended learning and virtual and physical mobility between the partner institutions.

OERCompBiomed brings together dedicated experts in biomedical science, medical ethics, learning analytics, and educational technology. All participants are affiliated to five institutions of higher education: University of Bergen, Karolinska Institutet, University of Turku, University of Eastern Finland and the University of Southern Denmark. These institutions collaborate in an established network of Masterâ€™s programmes in biomedicine (NordBioMedNet) that has worked productively since 2013 to enhance the quality of biomedical education.
